\title{Comparision between two Delimitations}
\usage{
compare2delimitations(deli1, deli2)
}
\arguments{
\item{deli1}{a character array (vector),containing a set of, for example, morphological identification (species names), to compare with}

\item{deli2}{a character array (vector),containing a set of, molecular delimitation (MOTU).}
}
\value{
a list containing the adjusted Rand index comparing the two partitions (a scalar). This index has zero expected value in the case
 of random partition, and it is bounded above by 1 in the case of perfect agreement between two partitions; the numbers of matches,
 splits,merges, and corresponding percentage.
}
\description{
Comparision between two delimitations of a group of samples, for instance,
traditionally morphological delimitation and molecular delimitation (MOTU).
}
\note{
This is for the same set of samples with two partitions/delimitations.
