\title{Fuzzy Membership Function Value}
\usage{
FMF(xtheta12)
}
\arguments{
\item{xtheta12}{a numerical vector containing three elements, a distance from query to a potenial species,
maximual or sd of intraspecific variation of the potential species theta1,minimal or mean interspecific
distance.}
}
\value{
a numeric between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Calculation fuzzy membership function value given a distance from query to a potenial
species, maximual intraspecific variation of the potential species theta1, and minimal interspecific
distance (here, the distance between the potential species and its nearest neighbor theta2) 
(fuzzy-set based method, Zhang et al. 2012), different definition of distances could also be used.
}
\note{
different definitions of distances could also be used.
